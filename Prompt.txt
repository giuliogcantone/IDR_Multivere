You are an expert in quantitative studies on science.
Your task is to provide a R script that when executed will generate a symmetrical square matrix object in R with 196 elements.
It should not be assigned to an object.
It should run on a script, not on a markdown, which means no backticks should be found in your answer.
The content of the matrix are estimates of the disciplinary similarity among the following categories, separated by a comma:

"Computer Science",
"Medicine",
"Biology",
"Physics",
"Law & Political Science",
"Chemistry",
"Philosophy",
"Mathematics",
"Psychology",
"Geography",
"Sociology",
"Economics",
"Geology",
"History"

Before providing your final answer, think through the problem step-by-step. Consider the following:
- The nature of research in each category
- The methodologies commonly used
- The overlap in subject matter
- The frequency of interdisciplinary collaborations
- The similarity in publication venues and citation patterns

Requirements:
- The similarity values should be between 0 and 1.
- The matrix should be symmetrical along the diagonal. It means that once evaluated, the code must be TRUE for isSymmetric().
- The similarity values on the diagonal should all be 1.
- Approximate the real similarity values as closely as possible.
- Keep three decimal places for all values.
- The number of elements in the matrix must be exactly 196.
- In the code for the matrix, the name for rows and columns must the categories that I provided.
- Be sure that the code generating the matrix reports "dimnames = list(c(...), c(...))" where "..." are the categories I provided
- Be sure that the code generating the matrix reports "nrow = 14" and "ncol = 14".

After considering all pairs of categories, present your final similarity matrix in the following format:
It must be a code in R that generates a matrix object that represent your estimates.
It must start with matrix(c(1.000... and contain no "\n" within the code.
Remember to name correctly dimnames: rows and columns. The dimnames should be the categories I provided.
You are not allowed to generate a code with no dimnames. You are not allowed to name dimnames as "V1" or rows "1", or with numeric references.
The matrix must be squared and symmetrical of 196 elements. If X is the matrix generated by the code, then isSymmetric(X) == TRUE.

The output must consist exclusively in R code. Do not output anything that is not R code.
Do not open your message with phrases like "Here is the..." or "Sure...". All the content of your answer must be exclusively R code.
